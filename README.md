# MultiDimSPCI
Official implementation of [Conformal prediction for multi-dimensional time series by ellipsoidal sets](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uN39Tt9P8b), which is accepted by ICML 2024 (spotlight).

Please direct implementation inquiries to cxu310@gatech.edu.

## Pre-requisites
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
This work is built on our previous published work [Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference for Time Series](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jJeY7w8YRz) (ICML 2023).  

See [wind_2d.ipynb](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/MultiDimSPCI/blob/main/wind_2d.ipynb) for a demonstration on 2d wind data.
